00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:05,358
The craziest thing just happened to me. It was last year,

2
00:00:05,444 --> 00:00:08,622
around Christmas, in October. I was driving home

3
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:12,186
from work, in my room, walking around, and my sister,

4
00:00:12,298 --> 00:00:16,126
my stepsister, she gave me this painting, right? But she drew it

5
00:00:16,148 --> 00:00:20,218
in Spanish so I couldn't even hear it. And it was actually so loud

6
00:00:20,314 --> 00:00:24,090
that I went blind. So I told her that I needed some watermelon

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,238
because my favorite color is seven on, God.

8
00:00:27,324 --> 00:00:30,390
Then she got stuck over a table, and she got, like,

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,134
pregnant with her first kid again. For the third time.

10
00:00:34,252 --> 00:00:37,538
And that's why you should treat others the way you want to be treated.

11
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:39,426
You're welcome for listening.
